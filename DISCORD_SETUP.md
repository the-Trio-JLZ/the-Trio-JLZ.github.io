# Discord Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide shows how to set up Discord notifications for form submissions and event updates.

## 1. Create Discord Webhook

### Step 1: Create a Discord Webhook
1. Go to your Discord server
2. Right-click on the channel where you want notifications
3. Select "Edit Channel"
4. Go to "Integrations" â†’ "Webhooks"
5. Click "New Webhook"
6. Give it a name like "ACM Forms Bot"
7. Copy the Webhook URL

### Step 2: Set Up Formspree Discord Integration
1. Go to your Formspree dashboard
2. For each form, go to "Settings" â†’ "Integrations"
3. Add Discord integration with your webhook URL
4. Configure the message format

Example Discord message format for Formspree:
```
ðŸ”” **New {{form_type}} Submission**
**Name:** {{name}}
**Email:** {{email}}
**Message/Details:** {{message}}
```

## 2. GitHub Actions Discord Integration

### Add Discord Webhook to GitHub Secrets
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
3. Add new repository secret:
   - Name: `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`
   - Value: Your Discord webhook URL

### The GitHub Action will automatically:
- Fetch Dragon Central RSS every 6 hours
- Convert to JSON format (solves CORS issues)
- Post updates to Discord when events change
- Commit updated events.json to repository

## 3. Form Submission Limits & Strategy

### Formspree Free Tier (5 submissions/month):
- **Contact Form:** 2 submissions allocated
- **3D Print Requests:** 2 submissions allocated  
- **Laptop Borrowing:** 1 submission allocated

### When limits are reached:
- Forms still work but require Formspree upgrade ($10/month)
- Discord notifications continue working
- All data is still collected

### Alternative: GitHub Issues Integration
If you prefer unlimited free submissions:
1. Set up GitHub Issues templates
2. Use GitHub's API to create issues from forms
3. Discord bot monitors GitHub Issues
4. More complex setup but completely free

## 4. Discord Bot Features (Optional Advanced Setup)

### Create a custom Discord bot that can:
- Monitor GitHub Issues for form submissions
- Post formatted messages with better styling
- React to messages with emojis
- Create threads for each form submission
- Send direct messages to board members

### Bot Commands Ideas:
- `!events` - Show upcoming events
- `!forms` - Show form submission count/limits
- `!website` - Show website statistics

## 5. Event Integration Workflow

```
Dragon Central RSS â†’ GitHub Action â†’ events.json â†’ Website Display
                                  â†“
                            Discord Notification
```

### Benefits:
- âœ… No CORS issues (server-side processing)
- âœ… Automatic updates every 6 hours
- âœ… Discord notifications for event changes
- âœ… Reliable and maintainable
- âœ… Version controlled event history
