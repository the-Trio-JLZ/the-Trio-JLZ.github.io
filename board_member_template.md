## Notes for Implementation:
- Ronnie's section will be styled differently (larger photo, more prominent name, additional details)
- All GitHub links will be validated and working
- Photos will be uniform in size but Ronnie's will be slightly larger
- Bios should be friendly but professional
- Years Active helps show experience and continuity
